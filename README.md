# Overview

This program aims at organizing a set of employees. With this software I wanted the user to have the ability to choose what gets done and see what happens.

This software includes three classes ''maybe four??"" that use inheritance and polymorphism to help the code fow better. The Employee class is the super class that contains the variables and methods that will be used in the other two sub classes, like the personal employee infomation and a method to display said information. The Add class is responsible for adding employees to the system and getting and setting the variables from the super class. The Edit class takes user input, converts it to an integer, and uses the integer as the list index number to remove an employee from the list. The program class reads and displays this information via a menu and user input.

The purpose of this software is to be able to add and edit a list of employees. Anyone that has been part of a businees knows that employee information is always changing, whether they're new employees that were just hired or employees that are leavg, there needs to be a way to organize, use, and edit that information.

# Development Environment

This software was written in VS Code.

This software is written in C#. C# is an object-oriented language that can be versatile depending on the program being written. It was released in 2000, so it's a little newer than some other languages.
